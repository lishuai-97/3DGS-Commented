# 3DGS-Commented (In Progress)

This repository features an annotated version of the official 3D Gaussian Splatting ([3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting)) implementation.

It is based on the foundational work provided by [3DGS-Commented](https://github.com/fengaba1818/3DGS-Commented).
